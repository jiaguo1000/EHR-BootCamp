Find details in this [post](https://www.jiaguo1000.com/lab1/). I was working as a teaching assistance to provide a guide of [MIMIC database](https://mimic.mit.edu) and lead a hands-on computer lab session for [Electronic Medical Records Boot Camp: Biostatistical methods for analyzing EMR data](http://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/precision-prevention/electronic-medical-records-boot-camp-biostatistical-methods-analyzing-emr-data) at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.
